## Chord Naming Guide

This guide provides a nomenclature for naming chords. You have to use this format if you want to use your own chords collection within the app.

### Basic Format

Chords are named in the format "RootNote" followed by any modifiers.

- **Root Note:** Start with the root note of the chord, which can be one of the following:

  - C, C#, Db, D, D#, Eb, E, F, F#, Gb, G, G#, Ab, A, A#, Bb, B

- **Chord Type:** Use the following modifiers to specify the chord type:

  - If it's a major chord, use just the root note (e.g., C).
  - For minor chords, add 'm' after the root note (e.g., Dm).
  - For diminished chords, add 'dim' after the root note (e.g., F#dim).
  - For augmented chords, add 'aug' after the root note (e.g., Aaug).

### Seventh (7th) Chords

- To indicate a dominant 7th chord, add '7' after the chord type (e.g., G7).
- For major 7th chords, add 'Maj7' after the chord type (e.g., CMaj7).
- For minor 7th chords, add 'm7' after the chord type (e.g., F#m7).
- For minor 7th flat five (half-diminished) chords, add 'm7b5' after the chord type (e.g., Cm7b5).

### Extensions

- For chords with extensions (9th, 11th), add the number after the chord type (e.g., D9, G11).
- For minor 9th chords, add 'm9' after the chord type (e.g., A#m9).
- For minor 11th chords, add 'm11' after the chord type (e.g., Bm11).
- For major 9th chords, add 'Maj9' after the chord type (e.g., EMaj9).

### Flat 5

- For chords with a flat 5, add 'b5' after the chord type (e.g., Cm7b5).

### Diminished 7th Chords

- To indicate a diminished 7th chord, add '째7' after the chord type (e.g., B째7).
- You can also write the diminished triads with just '째' (e.g., C째).

### Additional Chords

- There are additional chords like 'CMaj9', 'Dm11b5', 'Gm11b5', etc., which follow similar patterns as described above.
